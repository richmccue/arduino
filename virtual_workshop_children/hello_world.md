1.  If you haven’t already, please go to the TinkerCad website and [create an account](https://www.tinkercad.com/){:target="_blank"}

    Once you have the account created, go to Dashboard **->** select “**circuits**” on the left side panel **->** select “**Create new Circuit**”

    Materials needed (all of the materials are located in the Basic Components section on the right side, except for wires. You can also search for items):

    - Arduino Uno R3
    - Breadboard Small
    - 1 LED light.
    - 1 220-ohm (or 220 Ω) Resistor with the following striping from left to right: red, red, brown, gold.

    Connect as shown in this diagram:

2.  Once everything is connected, click “Start Simulation” in the top right corner. You should see the light starting to blink

3.  For fun, let’s make the LED light blink faster.  In the top right section click “**Code**”, scroll to the bottom of the code and change the two lines that say, “**delay(1000)**” to “**delay(250)**”.  Press “**Start Simulation**” and see the difference.   Feel free to play around with the code to see what changes. Have fun!
