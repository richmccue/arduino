3. For fun, let’s make the LED light blink faster.  In the top right section click “**Code**”, scroll to the bottom of the code and change the two lines that say, “**delay(1000)**” to “**delay(250)**”.  Press “**Start Simulation**” and see the difference.   Feel free to play around with the code to see what changes. Have fun!
