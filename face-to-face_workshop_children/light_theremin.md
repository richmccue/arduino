# Light Theremin

//insert photo here

If you and your group have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

1. If you haven’t already, please go to the Arduino website and [download the "Arduino IDE"](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software){:target="_blank"} for either Windows or Mac, and then install the software on your computer.

Materials needed:
          1 Piezo (this is basically a small speaker)
          1 Photoresistor (this is a light sensor)
          1 10k-ohm resistor with the following striping in order: brown, black, orange, gold
          1 Long Red Wire
          1 Long Black Wire
          2 Short Wires
          1 Medium Wire
          1 Long Wire

2. Connect as shown in this diagram (note: the Piezo legs are closer together than displayed here -- just make sure the two adjacent wires in Column A are in the same row as the Piezo legs):

Note: you can check out a [simulated version](https://goo.gl/Tq5TpD){:target="_blank"} of this Arduino project

3. Using the provided USB cable plug your Arduino into your computer.

4. Launch the arduino software.

5. Go to the top menu: “**File**” -> “**Examples**” -> “**10.StarterKit_BasicKit**” -> “**p06_LightTheremin**”

6. Upload the “**Light Theremin**” code to your Arduino by pressing the “**Upload**” button.

7. Once the code is uploaded and running, there is a 5 second initialization phase where the ambient light level is recorded. After that, move your finger around the photoresistor to make some crazy Theremin sounds!  Enjoy!
