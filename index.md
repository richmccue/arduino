- Introductory presentation: ?? min
- Hands-on activities: 120 min

## Why Program with Arduino? 

[Arduino](https://TOOL-URL-HERE.org/){:target="_blank"} Sample from Arduino Website

text in paragraph

This workshop uses the OpenSource _Taguette_ software because it is free to use and many find it easier to learn than [other popular commercial software packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_qualitative_data_analysis_software){:target="_blank"}. 

This workshop is not an endorsement of Taguette; there are many options for qualitative analysis and coding and other software may be better in other contexts. While an excellent teaching tool, _Taguette_ imposes some limitations that users should be aware of:

- Only text can be coded. For example videos and images can not be coded.
- Passanges coded with different tags have the same colour in Taguette. 
- Only basic analysis can be done in Taguette. External tools, like Microsoft Excel, can be used for more advanced analysis are covered in this workshop.

## Learning objectives - UPDATE FOR THE NEW TOOL

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Be able to discuss a range of problems Arduino can help solve including digital humanities problems (Arduino possibilities and limitations).
2. Know basic electronic principles including sensors and switches.
3. Cut and paste programming, with minor modifications to existing code.
4. Be able to wire up projects using a solderless breadboard.
5. Build the "Hello World" project for Arduino: Blink project.
6. Be able to form a simple circuit of their choice with a switch and output.
7. Know where to find other projects and tutorials for learning how to program Arduino.
