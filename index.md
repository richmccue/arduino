# Programmable Electronics with Arduino

- Pre-workshop activities: ?? min 
- Introductory presentation: ?? min
- Hands-on activities: 120 min

## Why Program with Arduino? 

The [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/){:target="_blank"} world is an accessible introduction to microcontrollers for anyone from casual hobbyists to professionals. Arduino offers affordable open-source hardware and software that enables users to design their own interactive technology.

Arduino is not the only way to work with microcontrollers. According to Arduino's introduction page, "There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package." (https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/introduction)

## Learning objectives - UPDATE FOR THE NEW TOOL

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Be able to discuss a range of problems Arduino can help solve including digital humanities problems (Arduino possibilities and limitations).
2. Know basic electronic principles including sensors and switches.
3. Cut and paste programming, with minor modifications to existing code.
4. Be able to wire up projects using a solderless breadboard.
5. Build the "Hello World" project for Arduino: Blink project.
6. Be able to form a simple circuit of their choice with a switch and output.
7. Know where to find other projects and tutorials for learning how to program Arduino.
